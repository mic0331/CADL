    "\n",
    "In the last session we created our first neural network.  We saw that in order to create a neural network, we needed to define a cost function which would allow gradient descent to optimize all the parameters in our network.  We also saw how neural networks become much more expressive by introducing series of linearities followed by non-linearities, or activation functions.  We then explored a fun application of neural networks using regression to learn to paint color values given x, y positions.  This allowed us to build up a sort of painterly like version of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll see how to construct a few more types of neural networks.  First, we'll explore a generative network called autoencoders.  This network can be extended in a variety of ways to include convolution, denoising, or a variational layer.  In Part Two, you'll then use a general autoencoder framework to encode your own list of images.  In Part three, we'll then explore a discriminative network used for classification, and see how this can be used for audio classification of music or speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "One main difference between these two networks are the data that we'll use to train them.  In the first case, we will only work with \"unlabeled\" data and perform unsupervised learning.  An example would be a collection of images, just like the one you created for assignment 1.  Contrast this with \"labeled\" data which allows us to make use of supervised learning.  For instance, we're given both images, and some other data about those images such as some text describing what object is in the image.  This allows us to optimize a network where we model a distribution over the images given that it should be labeled as something.  This is often a *much* simpler distribution to train, but with the expense of it being much harder to collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major directions of future research will be in how to better make use of unlabeled data and unsupervised learning methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture that autoencoders are great at \"compressing\" information.  The network's construction and cost function are just like what we've done in the last session.  The network is composed of a series of matrix multiplications and nonlinearities.  The only difference is the output of the network has exactly the same shape as what is input.  This allows us to train the network by saying that the output of the network needs to be just like the input to it, so that it tries to \"compress\" all the information in that video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders have some great potential for creative applications, as they allow us to compress a dataset of information and even *generate* new data from that encoding.  We'll see exactly how to do this with a basic autoencoder, and then you'll be asked to explore some of the extensions to produce your own encodings.\n",

Make sure you resize the images so that they are <= 200x200 pixels, otherwise the training will be *very* slow, and the montages we create will be too large.\n",

We can access \"batch generators\" of each of these sets by saying: `ds.train.next_batch`.  A generator is a really powerful way of handling iteration in Python.  If you are unfamiliar with the idea of generators, I recommend reading up a little bit on it, e.g. here: http://intermediatepythonista.com/python-generators - think of it as a for loop, but as a function.

The `deprocess` function should take the preprocessed image and undo the preprocessing steps.  Recall that the `ds` object contains the `mean` and `std` functions for access the mean and standarad deviation.  We'll be using the `preprocess` and `deprocess` functions on the input and outputs of the network.  Note, we could use Tensorflow to do this instead of numpy, but for sake of clarity, I'm keeping this separate from the Tensorflow graph.\n",

Then look at the other two: one using the Celeb Dataset; and lastly one which will download Sita Sings the Blues, rip the frames, and train a Variational Autoencoder on it.  This last one requires `ffmpeg` be installed (e.g. for OSX users, `brew install ffmpeg`, Linux users, `sudo apt-get ffmpeg-dev`, or else: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).  The Celeb and Sita Sings the Blues training require us to use an image pipeline, which I've mentioned briefly during the lecture.  This does many things for us: it loads data from disk in batches, decodes the data as an image, resizes/crops the image, and uses a multithreaded graph to handle it all.  It is *very* efficient and is the way to go when handling large image datasets.  \n",

    "The MNIST training does not use this.  Instead, the entire dataset is loaded into the CPU memory, and then fed in minibatches to the graph using Python/Numpy.  This is far less efficient, but will not be an issue for such a small dataset, e.g.  70k examples of 28x28 pixels = ~1.6 MB of data, easily fits into memory (in fact, it would really be better to use a Tensorflow variable with this entire dataset defined).  When you consider the Celeb Net, you have 200k examples of 218x178x3 pixels = ~700 MB of data.  That's just for the dataset.  When you factor in everything required for the network and its weights, then you are pushing it.  Basically this image pipeline will handle loading the data from disk, rather than storing it in memory.\n",

    "You'll now try to train your own autoencoder using this framework.  You'll need to get a directory full of 'jpg' files.  You'll then use the VAE framework and the `vae.train_vae` function to train a variational autoencoder on your own dataset.  This accepts a list of files, and will output images of the training in the same directory.  These are named \"test_xs.png\" as well as many images named prefixed by \"manifold\" and \"reconstruction\" for each iteration of the training.  After you are happy with your training, you will need to create a forum post with the \"test_xs.png\" and the very last manifold and reconstruction image created to demonstrate how the variational autoencoder worked for your dataset.  You'll likely need a lot more than 100 images for this to be successful.\n",

If you change the model, and already have a checkpoint by the same name, it will try to load the previous model and will fail.  Be sure to remove the old checkpoint or specify a new name for `ckpt_name`!  The default parameters shown below are what I have used for the celeb net dataset which has over 200k images.  You will definitely want to use a smaller model if you do not have this many images!  Explore!\n",
